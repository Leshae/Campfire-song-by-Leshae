Mama's taking us to the jungle

Mama's taking us to the jungle tomorrow
Where tomorrow?
Where tomorrow?
Mama's taking us to the jungle tomorrow
We can stay all day

How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle

See all the monkeys scritch scritch scratchin'
Jumpin' all around and scritch scritch scratchin'
Hangin' by their long tails scritch scritch scratchin'
